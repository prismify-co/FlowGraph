  summary: Configuration options for edge routing behavior.
  remarks: >-
    <p>

    EdgeRoutingOptions controls how edges are routed between nodes. Different routers

    may use different subsets of these options based on their capabilities.

    Corner radius for Step and SmoothStep edges.

    Controls how rounded the corners are at direction changes.

    Default is 10 pixels.
  remarks: >-
    <p>

    For <xref href="FlowGraph.Core.EdgeType.Step" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> edges, corners are always sharp (90°).

    For <xref href="FlowGraph.Core.EdgeType.SmoothStep" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> edges, this value determines the arc radius.

    </p>

    <p>

    The actual radius is clamped to not exceed half the segment length,

    ensuring corners don't overlap.

    Minimum distance from the port before the edge can make its first turn.

    Default is 50 pixels.
  remarks: >-
    <p>

    This creates a "stem" coming out of the port before the edge can bend.

    Helps prevent awkward curves that turn immediately at the node boundary.

    </p>

    <p>

    Similar to GoJS's fromEndSegmentLength and toEndSegmentLength properties.

    Padding around nodes for obstacle avoidance routing.

    Default is 10 pixels.
  remarks: >-
    <p>

    When routing edges around nodes, this padding ensures edges don't

    pass too close to node boundaries.

    </p>

    <p>

    Only used by routers that support obstacle avoidance (SmartBezier, AStar).

    Spacing between multiple edges connecting to the same port side.

  remarks: >-
    <p>

    When multiple edges connect to the same side of a node (e.g., all from the right),

    this value determines how far apart they are spread vertically or horizontally.

    </p>

    <p>

    Similar to GoJS's fromSpot/toSpot spreading behavior.

    <p>

    When true, if three edges all connect to the right side of a node,

    they will be spread vertically to avoid overlap.

    </p>

    <p>

    When false, all edges from the same side will connect at the same point.

    other nodes in the graph. This is a Pro feature.
