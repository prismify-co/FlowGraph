    A point in canvas coordinate space (logical graph coordinates).


    <p>

    Canvas coordinates represent the logical position of elements in the graph.

    Node positions, port centers, edge endpoints all use canvas coordinates.

    These values are stable regardless of zoom/pan - a node at (100, 200) stays

    at (100, 200) even when the user zooms or pans.

    </p>


    <p>

    <b>When to use:</b>

    <ul><li>Node positions (node.Position)</li><li>Port centers calculated from node geometry</li><li>Edge start/end points</li><li>Hit testing against graph elements</li><li>Selection bounds in graph space</li></ul>
