  summary: The type of element hit during a graph hit test.
  remarks: >-
    <p>

    Uses <xref href="System.FlagsAttribute" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> to enable efficient bitwise operations

    for processors that handle multiple element types. This allows O(1) type

    checking instead of list iteration on high-frequency events like PointerMoved.

    </p>

    <p>

    Example: A processor handling both Node and Group can use:

    <pre><code class="lang-csharp">HitTargetTypes.Node | HitTargetTypes.Group</code></pre>

    </p>
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: >-
      [Flags]

      public enum HitTargetType
