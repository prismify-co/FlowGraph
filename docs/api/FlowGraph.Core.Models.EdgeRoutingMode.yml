    Path is fully calculated by the router (default behavior).

    Waypoints in EdgeState are auto-generated by the routing algorithm.

  summary: >-
    Path uses only user-defined waypoints.

    Auto-routing is disabled; the edge passes directly through UserWaypoints.

    content: Manual = 1

  summary: >-
    Router calculates path but respects user waypoints as constraints.

    The path will pass through UserWaypoints while avoiding obstacles.

    Combines manual control with automatic obstacle avoidance.

  syntax:
    content: Guided = 2
