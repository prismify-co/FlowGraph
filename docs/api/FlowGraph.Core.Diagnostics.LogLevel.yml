    Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data.

    These messages are disabled by default and should never be enabled in a production environment.

  summary: >-
    Logs that are used for interactive investigation during development.

    These logs should primarily contain information useful for debugging.
  example: []

    Logs that track the general flow of the application.

    These logs should have long-term value.
  example: []

  summary: >-
    Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow,

    but do not otherwise cause the application execution to stop.
  example: []

    startLine: 35
  assemblies:
  - FlowGraph.Core
  namespace: FlowGraph.Core.Diagnostics
  summary: >-
    Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure.

    These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure.
  example: []
  syntax:
