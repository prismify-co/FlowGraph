  summary: >-
    Represents a connection between two nodes.

    Uses a Definition (immutable) + State (mutable) composition pattern.

    Implements <xref href="FlowGraph.Core.Elements.ICanvasElement" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> for unified element handling.
  remarks: >-
    <p>

    The edge's structural properties (Source, Target, ports, type, markers) are stored

    in the <xref href="FlowGraph.Core.Edge.Definition" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> record. Runtime state (selection, waypoints) is

    stored in the <xref href="FlowGraph.Core.Edge.State" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> object.

    </p>

    <p>

    For backward compatibility, pass-through properties are provided that delegate

    to either Definition or State as appropriate.

    </p>
